Recipe

1 stick butter

1 cup milk

2 large eggs

1 tablespoon vegetable oil

1 cup flour

4 teaspoons baking powder

4 teaspoons sugar

1 teaspoon salt

1.Melt a stick of butter in a heavy skillet.  Whisk together a cup of milk, 2 large eggs and a tablespoon of vegetable oil, then add the butter. Put the buttery skillet back on the burner, ready for the pancakes.

2. Whisk the flour with the baking powder, sugar and salt.  Whisk the mix mixture in until its combined.  Add a bit more milk if you think it’s too thick.

3. Pour some batter into the skillet. The size is up to you; sometimes I make them tiny for children, sometimes I make them ludicrously large. Watch as the bubbles appear in the batter, grow larger, and then pop and vanish.  When they’ve all popped, carefully flip the pancake and cook the other side. 

4. Rush the pancakes to the table as each one is finished. You want them hot, sweet, salty and a little bit crisp. You want the memory to linger with your family as they move through their day.

(The batter will keep in the refrigerator for a couple of days; you will probably have to thin it out with a bit more milk before using.)
